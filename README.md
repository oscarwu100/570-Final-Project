# 570-Final-Project
1) Run from top to bottom in .ipynb file
2) Describe:
 a) Most code in Truck.ipynb, FRCNN balloon.ipynb, MRCNN balloon.ipynb.
    Reference: https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2
 b) Changed dataset for Truck.ipynb, FRCNN balloon.ipynb, MRCNN balloon.ipynb.
    FRCNN ASLL.ipynb, FRCNN BCCD.ipynb modified from Truck.ipynb, FRCNN balloon.ipynb, MRCNN balloon.ipynb.
 c) Only a few part in FRCNN ASLL.ipynb, FRCNN BCCD.ipynb
3) 
  Truck.ipynb: found from https://cocodataset.org/#home, it is just a picture.
  FRCNN balloon.ipynb, MRCNN balloon.ipynb: balloon dataset with 255 images in train file with jason file.
